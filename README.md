# WEBUNDO!

This is a docker image I base my other development images off of so I get a certain baseline of
luxury tooling all in good working order.

If you like it but you don't like something about it then fork you.

I mean that in the nicest possible way.  Just fork it and do your thing.

That is the webundo way.

WEBUNDO! à¥²

P.S. Oh also it's voice controlled so you can say "Webundo, clojurescript-om
<name>!", "Webundo, php5! <name>", "Webundo, rails4! <name>" and so on and
you'll get a scaffolded project and a browser open pointing to it and and editor
window pointing at e.g. the routes file if it's a web framework, etc.
