# WEBUNDO!

This is a docker image I base my other development images off of so I get a certain baseline of
luxury tooling all in good working order.

If you like it but you don't like something about it then fork you.

I mean that in the nicest possible way.  Just fork it and do your thing.

That is the webundo way.
